## RE Asset Browser Setup

1. Extract the required game files before importing assets
2. Open **Edit → Preferences → Add-ons → RE Mesh Editor**
3. Set **Asset Library Path** to the folder where downloaded libraries should be stored
4. In **Chunk Path List**, add the game and its extracted `natives\STM` folder
   For example: `E:\SF6Extract\natives\stm`
5. Use **Download RE Asset Library** or **Import Local .reassetlib**
6. Open Blender's Asset Browser and select `RE Assets - GAME`
7. Select **All** or a catalog, refresh the library if necessary and drag a mesh into the scene

RE Asset Browser mesh imports use the normal REME import settings and require the matching extracted game files to remain available.

“Supported” means the corresponding format versions have importer mappings. It does not guarantee perfect reconstruction of every material, effect, animation or blend shape.

## Street Fighter 6 Support

Street Fighter 6 material import is experimental. The addon can reconstruct costume colors from extracted CMD `.user.2` files and apply them to supported MDF materials.

### Import Options

- **SF6 Costume Index** selects the costume folder containing the CMD files. For example, `1` selects folder `001`.
- **SF6 Color Index** selects the CMD color file. For example, `1` selects `cmd_001.user.2`.

Shared character meshes stored under costume folder `000` can use CMD data from the selected costume folder.

Example for Costume 2, Color 1:

```text
SF6 Costume Index: 2
SF6 Color Index: 1
```

## Pragmata

Retail Pragmata character meshes use **`typing` 2** blend shapes (IEEE float16 xyz in the vertex-buffer tail), not MH Wilds packed 11/10/11 deltas. Extra-weight (vertex element type 7) is a second bone-index pack, not a 7th–12th influence.

Export is a **paste-back** of imported type-4 / type-7 / morph-aux tables. Blender cannot invent those streams.

**Not supported:** remesh, retopo, dissolve, add/delete verts, or any vertex-count change; weight-paint / vertex-group edits (groups are ignored on write); `autoSolveRepeatedUVs` / `preserveSharpEdges` on a morphing face (they split verts and drop `pragmata_*`); exporting a face that was never imported with this persist path; building a new extra-weight or aux table from Blender data.

**Allowed edits** (imported tables must still line up): move existing verts; reorder existing verts (`pragmata_src_index` permutation); edit shape-key **deltas**. Vertex count, armature, and the pasted streams must stay. Same-topology sculpt is the supported sculpt path because it is the only one that does not break those tables.

Details, buffer layout, and approaches that fail: **[docs/PRAGMATA.md](docs/PRAGMATA.md)**.

## Known Limitations
- Blender 5.1 is not currently supported
- Monster Hunter Wilds support remains experimental
- Static Pragmata MPLY environment geometry is supported but skinned MPLY clusters do not reconstruct joint weights yet
- Pragmata hair uses its NROC maps and a primary anisotropic highlight approximation, parallax-coupled unique albedo and secondary hair lobes are not reconstructed
- Pragmata face remesh, retopo, dissolve, add/delete verts, or any vertex-count change cannot round-trip extra-weight or morph aux (those tables cannot be invented)
- Pragmata export pastes imported type-4/type-7 streams; vertex-group weight paint is not written
- Pragmata `autoSolveRepeatedUVs` / `preserveSharpEdges` on a morphing face split verts and drop `pragmata_*` attributes
- Pragmata face export requires a persist import (`pragmata_*` on the `.blend`); a mesh never imported with this path cannot round-trip extra-weight / aux
- Blend-shape support varies by game and mesh format
- SF6 blend shapes are kept at zero by default
- Automatic SF6 JCNS pose-corrective drivers are disabled while their vertex mapping remains experimental
- SF6 `FakeSqhereMap` eye reflections are not supported yet
- Extreme FK poses may not match the game's deformation without pose-corrective shapes
- The imported skeleton does not include custom IK or animator-facing controls
- Blend-shape export is not guaranteed for every supported import path
- Damage, sweat, animated muscle, cloth-wave and some auxiliary SF6 effects are not reconstructed
- RE Asset Browser drag import currently supports `MESH` assets only and does not automatically extract files from game PAK archives

## Roadmap

### Near Term
- Validate Street Fighter 6 materials across more fighters, costumes, color variants and shader types
- Add automated regression tests for CMD parsing and material matching
- Improve texture import reliability and support for newer compression formats
- Validate compatibility with RE2, RE3, RE4R, RE7RT and newer RE Engine titles

### Mesh And Format Support
- Validate Monster Hunter Wilds mesh import across more character, armor, weapon and environment assets
- Regression test legacy mesh and blend-shape import paths
- Continue investigating blend-shape / shape-key export support
- Improve support for newer mesh/material variations used by SF6, PRAGMATA, MH Wilds and future RE Engine games
- Reduce hardcoded format assumptions where possible

### Code Quality
- Refactor shader and material generation for easier maintenance
- Improve import/export performance
- Expand documentation for contributors and testers
